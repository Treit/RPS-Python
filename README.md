# RPS-Python
Rock Paper Scissors in Python - 1st learning project

This is my first solo project after going through a Python tutorial. The program will allow users to play the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer.

The first version will be text based and simply exit after the game has completed. Improved features such as replay, best 2 out of 3, graphics, and perhaps a window'd UI will be added in subsquent versions.

Thanks for checking out my program!
