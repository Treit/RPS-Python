# RPS-Python
Rock Paper Scissors in Python - 1st learning project

This is my first solo project after going through a Python tutorial. The program will allow users to play the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer.

The first version will be text based and simply exit after the game has completed. Improved features such as replay, best 2 out of 3, graphics, and perhaps a window'd UI will be added in subsquent versions.

Thanks for checking out my program!

A little about me - I am a sound engineer who can no longer physically move the gear required in my line of work so I am teaching myself to be a software developer.
